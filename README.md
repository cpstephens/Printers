Printers
========

Printer application is an internal application that will give you access to all the printers on the internal network. This application should have a main page that displays four locations/branches that host network printers. Each printer will be assigned with an IP address and a plate number. I have already a very simple html page that is already available on the network, but needs some serious enchancement attention.
